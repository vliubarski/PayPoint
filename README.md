## The problem

A CustomerService class has a GetCustomer method with the following signature

`public Customer GetCustomer(int customerId, bool isCustomerArchived)`

## Your task

We would like you to refactor the `GetCustomer` method in the `CustomerService` class in order to make the class easier to maintain. 
While undertaking this code test, you are free to change anything (method signatures, constructors, etc.). 

1. You should consider the SOLID principles, the readability of the code and where tests might be appropriate.
2. The unit test project uses NUnit, and Moq.
